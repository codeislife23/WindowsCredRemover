# WindowsCredRemover
PowerShell script that you can use to remove Windows credentials from Credential Manager

Run it in a PowerShell console with administrator privileges.

Please note that this script will remove all stored credentials. Make sure you understand the implications and have a backup of any credentials you might need before running it. Also, be cautious when using scripts that modify system settings, especially with elevated privileges. Always test scripts in a safe environment before applying them in a production setting.
